### Hi there 🤓

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! 

My name is Kayla and I started learning to code this year. In May 2020 I enrolled in a 💻 web development bootcamp. I may be new to the bizz but I'm proud of the progress I've made in the past few months and I'm excited to keep learning. 

📚 I'm currently studying: 📚

- 🕹️ Game making with Vanilla JavaScript 
- ⚛️ Redux
- ✔️ Vue.js
- 💄Styled components

So take a look around and get in touch if you have anything to ask or share. You can reach me here:

    return takeNap(kayla);
    } else {
    return writeCode(kayla);
