### Hi there 🤓

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page. It's probably easy to see but I'm new to this. I started learning to code in May 2020 when I enrolled in a 💻 web development bootcamp. That said, I'm proud of the progress I've made in the past few months, and I'm excited to keep learning. 📚

So take a look around, and get in touch if you have anything to ask or share. You can reach me here:

Thanks and happy coding!
